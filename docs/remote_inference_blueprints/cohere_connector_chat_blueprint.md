### Cohere Chat Connector Blueprint:

This blueprint will show you how to connect a Cohere chat model to your Opensearch cluster. You will require a Cohere API key to create a connector.

It is suggested to use the default `command` model for using Chat. Cohere's Chat endpoint also features Retrievel Augmented Generation (or RAG) parameters, by adding `connectors` or `documents` in your request body, in addition to allowing you to pass a `conversation_id` to provide context to Cohere's model. 

See [Cohere's /chat API docs](https://docs.cohere.com/reference/chat) for more details.

#### 1. Create your Model connector and Model group

##### 1a. Register Model group

```json
POST /_plugins/_ml/model_groups/_register
{
  "name": "cohere_model_group",
  "description": "Your Cohere model group"
}
```

This request response will return the `model_group_id`, note it down.

##### 1b. Create Connector

Refer to the [/chat API docs](https://docs.cohere.com/reference/chat) for more parameters. This API request will create a connector pointing to Cohere's /chat API using the default `command` model.

To enable Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) features, you can add any of these optional parameters:
- `connectors`: Specifies extra Cohere connectors to query prior to generation. Important note that these [connectors](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/connectors) differ from Opensearch connectors. These are connectors that are configurable and deployable within the Cohere ecosystem. You can enable Web search to start by passing in `[{"id": "web-search"}]` to this parameter. 
- `documents`: List of [documents](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag#document-mode) used to augment generation.
- `chat_history`: List of previous messages between the user and model. 

For more details on these, please refer to the [Cohere docs](https://docs.cohere.com/reference/chat).

Later, when calling the newly created Predict action, you will pass `message` and any extra parameters you've included to the request.

```json
POST /_plugins/_ml/connectors/_create
{
  "name": "Cohere Chat Model",
  "description": "The connector to Cohere's public chat API",
  "version": "1",
  "protocol": "http",
  "credential": {
    "cohere_key": "<ENTER_COHERE_API_KEY_HERE>"
  },
  "parameters": {
    "model": "command"
  },
  "actions": [
    {
      "action_type": "predict",
      "method": "POST",
      "url": "https://api.cohere.ai/v1/chat",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${credential.cohere_key}",
        "Request-Source": "unspecified:opensearch"
      },
      "request_body": "{ \"message\": \"${parameters.message}\", \"model\": \"${parameters.model}\" }"
    }
  ]
}
```

This request response will return the `connector_id`, note it down.

##### 1c. Register your model with the connector

You will now register the model you created using the `model_group_id` and `connector_id` from the previous requests.

```json
POST /_plugins/_ml/models/_register
{
    "name": "Cohere Chat Model",
    "function_name": "remote",
    "model_group_id": "<MODEL_GROUP_ID>",
    "description": "Your Cohere Chat Model",
    "connector_id": "<CONNECTOR_ID>"
}
```

This will create a registration task, the response should look like:

```json
{
  "task_id": "9bXpRY0BRil1qhQaUK-u",
  "status": "CREATED",
  "model_id": "9rXpRY0BRil1qhQaUK_8"
}
```

##### 1d. Deploy model

The last step is to deploy the Model. Use the `model_id` returned by the registration request, and run:

```json
POST /_plugins/_ml/models/<MODEL_ID>/_deploy
```

This will once again spawn a task to deploy your Model, with a response that will look like:

```json
{
  "task_id": "97XrRY0BRil1qhQaQK_c",
  "task_type": "DEPLOY_MODEL",
  "status": "COMPLETED"
}
```

You can run the GET tasks request again to verify the status.

```json
GET /_plugins/_ml/tasks/<TASK_ID>
```

Once this is complete, your Model is deployed and ready!

##### 1e. Test model

You can try this request to test that the Model behaves correctly:

Note: `conversation_id` here is the string value for "1", but you can use any string value, such as generating a uuidv4 string. This value will be org-specific and you will need to manage it on your application side.

```json
POST /_plugins/_ml/models/<MODEL_ID_HERE>/_predict
{
  "parameters": {
    "message": "What is the weather like in London?"
  }
}
```

It should return a response similar to this:

```json
{
  "inference_results": [
    {
      "output": [
        {
          "name": "response",

Congratulations! You've successfully created a chat connector.
